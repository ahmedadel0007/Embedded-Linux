Question 
 Handle all error that might the user take using the script and display a message to indicate to him what he did wrong.

Answer 
   these are the list of errors i took care of :
       1-If the user provides an incorrect number of arguments.
       2-If the configuration file is not found.
       3-If the specified key is not found in the configuration file. 
       
       all these errors are handled in the bash script using if conditions for each error and all explined in the script comments 




      chmod command is not working even though i installed the package of it 
      while ./config_parser.sh is working just fine and that is shown in the screenshoot given 

thank you
